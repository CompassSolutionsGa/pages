If you rely on inbound leads, your roofing contact form is one of your highest-impact pages.

## Recommended form fields for Roofing
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- Property address or ZIP code
- Service needed (repair, replacement, inspection)
- Roof type (shingle, metal, tile, flat)
- Issue type (leak, storm damage, age, missing shingles)
- Timeline (ASAP, 1-2 weeks, 30+ days)

## Example questions to include
- What problem are you seeing (leak, missing shingles, sagging, etc.)?
- When did you first notice it?
- Is this storm-related damage?
- Do you know your roof’s approximate age?
- Do you want repair options, replacement options, or both?

## A/B tests worth running
- Test CTA: Get a free roof inspection vs Request a quote
- Test showing "Insurance help available" badge vs no badge
- Test 3-field quick form vs full detailed form
- Test asking for address early vs after contact info
- Test timeline dropdown vs free-text "When do you need this?"

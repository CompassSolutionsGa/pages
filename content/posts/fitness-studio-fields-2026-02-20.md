Most fitness studio sites don’t need a redesign to get more leads, they need clearer forms and better testing.

## Recommended form fields for Fitness Studio
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- Goal (weight loss, strength, classes, personal training)
- Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Preferred schedule (mornings, evenings, weekends)
- Interested in trial? (yes/no)
- Location (if multiple)

## Example questions to include
- What’s your main goal right now?
- What type of training do you prefer (classes, 1:1, open gym)?
- How often do you want to work out per week?
- What days/times work best?
- Any injuries or limitations we should know? (optional)

## A/B tests worth running
- Test CTA: Claim a free trial vs Get class schedule
- Test goal buttons vs dropdown
- Test asking frequency (per week) vs not asking
- Test adding social proof near CTA vs none
- Test "Text me the schedule" option vs email-only

## Quick setup
1. Open FormHuntsman
2. Add your domain
3. Run a scan and pick one small test to launch

## Next steps
Run one experiment, measure results, then iterate. Small wins compound fast when you keep a simple testing rhythm.

Most chiropractor sites don’t need a redesign to get more leads, they need clearer forms and better testing.

## Recommended form fields for Chiropractor
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- Primary concern (back, neck, shoulder, sciatica, headache)
- Injury type (work, auto, sports, chronic)
- Pain level (1-10)
- New patient? (yes/no)
- Preferred appointment time

## Example questions to include
- Where are you feeling pain or discomfort?
- Did this start from an injury or develop over time?
- How long have you had symptoms?
- Have you seen a chiropractor before?
- Are you looking for pain relief, mobility improvement, or both?

## A/B tests worth running
- Test CTA: Schedule a consultation vs Get relief today
- Test pain scale slider vs dropdown vs no pain scale
- Test "New patient offer" line vs none
- Test injury type question early vs later
- Test showing testimonials near form vs below fold

## Quick setup
1. Open FormHuntsman
2. Add your domain
3. Run a scan and pick one small test to launch

## Next steps
Run one experiment, measure results, then iterate. Small wins compound fast when you keep a simple testing rhythm.

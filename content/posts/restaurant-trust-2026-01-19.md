If you rely on inbound leads, your restaurant contact form is one of your highest-impact pages.

## Recommended form fields for Restaurant
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- Request type (reservation, catering, private event)
- Party size
- Date
- Time
- Dietary notes (optional)

## Example questions to include
- Are you booking a reservation, catering, or an event?
- What date/time are you looking for?
- How many guests?
- Any dietary restrictions or special requests?
- What’s the best way to confirm with you?

## A/B tests worth running
- Test CTA: Reserve a table vs Check availability
- Test date/time picker vs simple dropdowns
- Test showing peak hours warning vs none
- Test separating catering form from reservation form
- Test adding "Response within X minutes" promise vs none

1. Open FormHuntsman
2. Add your domain
3. Run a scan and pick one small test to launch

## Next steps
Run one experiment, measure results, then iterate. Small wins compound fast when you keep a simple testing rhythm.

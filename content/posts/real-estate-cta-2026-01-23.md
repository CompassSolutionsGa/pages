A great real estate service page can still underperform if the lead form creates friction.

## Recommended form fields for Real Estate
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- I am a (buyer, seller, renter, investor)
- Property type (single-family, condo, multifamily, land)
- Location / ZIP code
- Budget or price range
- Timeline (ASAP, 30-60 days, 3-6 months, just browsing)

## Example questions to include
- Are you buying, selling, renting, or investing?
- What area(s) are you focused on?
- What’s your timeline to move or list?
- Are you already pre-approved for financing?
- Any must-haves (beds/baths, lot size, school zone, etc.)?

## A/B tests worth running
- Test CTA: Get matched with listings vs Talk to an agent
- Test buyer/seller choice as buttons vs dropdown
- Test asking budget early vs later
- Test multi-step intake vs single long form
- Test adding "Get alerts by text" option vs email-only

## Quick setup
1. Open FormHuntsman
2. Add your domain
3. Run a scan and pick one small test to launch

## Next steps
Run one experiment, measure results, then iterate. Small wins compound fast when you keep a simple testing rhythm.

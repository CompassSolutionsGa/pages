Most plumbing sites don’t need a redesign to get more leads, they need clearer forms and better testing.

## Recommended form fields for Plumbing
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- Service category (leak, clog, water heater, toilet, drain)
- Urgency (emergency, today, this week)
- Location / ZIP code
- Best time to contact
- Preferred contact method (call/text)

## Example questions to include
- What’s the issue (leak, clog, no hot water, low pressure)?
- Is water currently leaking or causing damage?
- Where is the problem located (kitchen, bathroom, basement)?
- When did it start?
- Any troubleshooting already attempted?

## A/B tests worth running
- Test CTA: Get a plumber today vs Schedule service
- Test urgency selector at top vs mid-form
- Test "Text me a quote" option vs call-only
- Test showing service areas list vs hidden
- Test adding "Emergency response" trust line vs none

## Quick setup
1. Open FormHuntsman
2. Add your domain
3. Run a scan and pick one small test to launch

## Next steps
Run one experiment, measure results, then iterate. Small wins compound fast when you keep a simple testing rhythm.
